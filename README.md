# Drowsiness_Detect
Our website-based drowsiness detection system uses Computer Vision to monitor the driver's face and gestures in real-time. It logs alarm activations and, if the driver doesn't wake up, alerts a trusted contact with the driver's location and a message to notify them. Enhancing driver safety with technology.
